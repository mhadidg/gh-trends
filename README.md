Something cool coming soon... or maybe not.

This project scans trending GitHub repositories, scores and ranks them, and publishes the best picks. All running fully
on GitHub Actions. Serverless, zero operational cost, and fully automated.

Currently publishes to:

- 📧 Email via Buttondown (would require subscription, I might drop it)
- 📝 GitHub Releases
- 📡 RSS feed (see `feed` dir)
